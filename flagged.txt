---Who+got+in+during+the+bear+market%3F---
I was really lucky that most of my FOMOing into the alt market during November and December came off profits from ETH and one completely flukey bet on a shitcoin. 
It still meant that my buys of the better researched coins came at ATH and the bear was painful to watch although I never lost more than I had originally put in. 
I bought some of the dips as I had faith I had bought the right coins that had long term prospects but couldn't dollar average cost down as much as I wanted cos I didn't have that much spare fiat I was willing to risk, but now it's going up I am loving the gains. 
Am interested to know if many people bought in just during this last bear run and why. 
Was it luck or was anyone clever enough to see the previous high was over extended (there were warning signs and people calling it, i even read an article that said you were likely to make more money by being patient even through the rises and waiting for the crash, I just ignored it like a fool) and sell out in late December to buy in now?
To all the people that didn't sell at the bottom though, this is now your reward :-)

I've noticed that over the last few months, there has been a a rare number of people excited about crypto. Now that there have been a few days of green, people are suddenly posting memes, and asking the age ol' questions such as 'should I invest in xyzshitcoin', and 'is this a good time to buy abcevenshittercoin?'    

'**So what**', you say?  

**Well let it serve as a friendly reminder to you:**  

 - You should have been buying during the bear market
 - In fact, even if you bought at a high, then you should have dollar-cost averaged your buys  
 - you should have invested in tech after you've done your due diligence and research on the crypto coin   


The reason we tend to buy during the green and not the red is because *Emotion* over *Logic*. The typical [market cycle definitely plays on our emotions](https://blockogy.com/hangout/jim-carreys-recent-experience-crypto/) and unfortunately, emotions get the better of us. I understand that. But if you're investing in crypto, [let logic triumph and understand that you can actually profit in a bear market](https://blockogy.com/cryptocurrency/surviving-bear-crypto-market/).  

**So what plays on our emotions and what should you do:**  

 - Understand FUD, where it's coming from, and reasons for it. Not all
   FUD is trolling.
 - Don't buy from FOMO! This is bad.
 - If you are panic buying in FOMO, this could be the worst thing you
   may be doing to your portfolio! - you've probably missed the boat. Let it be otherwise know that you are risking a lot!
 - [Don't be like   Derp](https://blockogy.com/hangout/investing-in-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-belike/). No one wants to be like Derp, so [don't be like
   Derp](https://blockogy.com/hangout/investing-in-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-belike/)!   


There are plenty of youTube channels, websites and educational resources that are available for free, that you should be keeping up     to date with on a *regular* basis- not just when the markets are green and there are higher potential of pump and dumps!

To make money, you need to *buy low, sell high*. Duh? I think we all know that is easier said than done because emotions >> logic. **But reverse the equation and let logic >> emotion**.  

This is important. It's not just about money. It's not just about profits. It's about creating a better cryptosphere and creating a wider adoption of blockchain. If people invest in coins and lose money, that means, they are less likely to be positive about it, less likely to promote it, in-fact, the more people lose, the more FUD it creates.  

So yeah, Logic. Not emotions. Happy crypto trading everyone!

Apologies if this is against the rules, but this is something I've been working on as a side project for the last few months and thought you guys might be interested: https://cryptoempire.io/

It's still a bit buggy and incomplete (the mobile ux needs a lot of work, the leaderboard isn't functional yet, etc.), but I've reached a point where I'm not totally ashamed of sharing it :)

Any feedback would be most welcome!
