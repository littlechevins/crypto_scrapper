---Who+got+in+during+the+bear+market%3F---
I was really lucky that most of my FOMOing into the alt market during November and December came off profits from ETH and one completely flukey bet on a shitcoin. 
It still meant that my buys of the better researched coins came at ATH and the bear was painful to watch although I never lost more than I had originally put in. 
I bought some of the dips as I had faith I had bought the right coins that had long term prospects but couldn't dollar average cost down as much as I wanted cos I didn't have that much spare fiat I was willing to risk, but now it's going up I am loving the gains. 
Am interested to know if many people bought in just during this last bear run and why. 
Was it luck or was anyone clever enough to see the previous high was over extended (there were warning signs and people calling it, i even read an article that said you were likely to make more money by being patient even through the rises and waiting for the crash, I just ignored it like a fool) and sell out in late December to buy in now?
To all the people that didn't sell at the bottom though, this is now your reward :-)

I've noticed that over the last few months, there has been a a rare number of people excited about crypto. Now that there have been a few days of green, people are suddenly posting memes, and asking the age ol' questions such as 'should I invest in xyzshitcoin', and 'is this a good time to buy abcevenshittercoin?'    

'**So what**', you say?  

**Well let it serve as a friendly reminder to you:**  

 - You should have been buying during the bear market
 - In fact, even if you bought at a high, then you should have dollar-cost averaged your buys  
 - you should have invested in tech after you've done your due diligence and research on the crypto coin   


The reason we tend to buy during the green and not the red is because *Emotion* over *Logic*. The typical [market cycle definitely plays on our emotions](https://blockogy.com/hangout/jim-carreys-recent-experience-crypto/) and unfortunately, emotions get the better of us. I understand that. But if you're investing in crypto, [let logic triumph and understand that you can actually profit in a bear market](https://blockogy.com/cryptocurrency/surviving-bear-crypto-market/).  

**So what plays on our emotions and what should you do:**  

 - Understand FUD, where it's coming from, and reasons for it. Not all
   FUD is trolling.
 - Don't buy from FOMO! This is bad.
 - If you are panic buying in FOMO, this could be the worst thing you
   may be doing to your portfolio! - you've probably missed the boat. Let it be otherwise know that you are risking a lot!
 - [Don't be like   Derp](https://blockogy.com/hangout/investing-in-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-belike/). No one wants to be like Derp, so [don't be like
   Derp](https://blockogy.com/hangout/investing-in-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-belike/)!   


There are plenty of youTube channels, websites and educational resources that are available for free, that you should be keeping up     to date with on a *regular* basis- not just when the markets are green and there are higher potential of pump and dumps!

To make money, you need to *buy low, sell high*. Duh? I think we all know that is easier said than done because emotions >> logic. **But reverse the equation and let logic >> emotion**.  

This is important. It's not just about money. It's not just about profits. It's about creating a better cryptosphere and creating a wider adoption of blockchain. If people invest in coins and lose money, that means, they are less likely to be positive about it, less likely to promote it, in-fact, the more people lose, the more FUD it creates.  

So yeah, Logic. Not emotions. Happy crypto trading everyone!

Apologies if this is against the rules, but this is something I've been working on as a side project for the last few months and thought you guys might be interested: https://cryptoempire.io/

It's still a bit buggy and incomplete (the mobile ux needs a lot of work, the leaderboard isn't functional yet, etc.), but I've reached a point where I'm not totally ashamed of sharing it :)

Any feedback would be most welcome!

---London+Football+Exchange---
Words: Jim Aylward, Media & Entertainment Advisor at The London Football Exchange

 

Of course, football is already undergoing a period of significant change. Digital technology and the rise of social media has seen engagement with major leagues across Europe soar – as fans across the world consume football through a range of new formats.

 

The sport has become truly global to the extent that a fan in Thailand can now as involved in the fortunes of their team in the Premier League as those who live in the proximity of the stadium.

 

But true disruption of industries usually takes the form of a technology that improves the service offered, either by pushing down prices, offering a better service, or creating a deeper bond. In fact, some of the most successful companies in existence today deliver all three.

 

So let’s take a look at a range of technologies changing football today, and the extent to which they are benefitting its customers – the fans.

 

Disruption on the field

Leading football clubs nowadays use a wide range of technologies to analyse players’ performance on the pitch. In fact, all 20 clubs in the Premier League – and many in the lower divisions – employ data analysts to make sense of this information.

 

But it seems the influence of analytics over football has only just begun. A group of sports scientists from the respected John Moores University in Liverpool argue the use of artificial intelligence is about to revolutionise football management and reveal the true impact of each specific player on the outcome of a game.

 

Just last month FIFA approved the use of Video Assistant Referees (VAR) which will see technology used to assist referees make decisions in-play, it is the biggest shake up in football’s rules for many years and is likely to lead to an intense debate about the extent to which it is improving football.

 

Entering the fray

The disruption to the status quo of football broadcasting in the last twenty years has unquestionably transformed the quality of British football being served up to fans.

 

The Premier League has become the main beneficiary of the global football broadcasting boom, with three-year television rights recently being sold for around £4.5billion to Sky and BT. Meanwhile, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and other international media giants could be waiting in the wings for the next wave of disruption.

 

This has led to soaring wages for Premier League footballers, and an influx of international stars. Arguably, a better standard of football is being witnessed. And stadiums have been modernised too.

 

More disruption is needed

Yet in other areas not much change has occurred at all. The way that tickets are sold and distributed has barely changed for a generation. Most football clubs are outsourcing their match day and season ticketing processes to third party platforms with fees of up to 5%. At the top end the game is more plagued by touting than ever before. This is leading to ever growing disgruntlement from fans.

 

While fans in football stadiums have always carried significant power – with their collective support or disapproval often making or breaking the careers of managers – the real power in football has always resided with the club owners. Fans increasingly report that they feel divorced from the ownership of their club, and when they do want to get involved are excluded from meaningful engagement including realistic ways to support clubs they own through fundraising initiatives.

 

How technology can assist

Now new Blockchain technology could change that. The technology gives clubs a new opportunity to implement a range of initiatives that will provide better services to fans and improve levels of engagements.

 

This includes modernising ticketing arrangements and creating a financing infrastructure that gives fans an opportunity to have a stake in their clubs. The savings and investments this creates will allow more money to be invested in developing the football producer such as improved facilities, more youth training and savings even to be passed on to fans.

If you fat finger a sell order that's under 5% of the market price, Binance will warn you of this with a pop up.

https://imgur.com/a/jsYLQe7

However, if you click the X to close the window and go back to correctly adjust the price, *it will still place your order as if it were valid*...

You **have to click NO** on the dialog box to cancel the sell and adjust price accordingly.

Please Binance fix this - I just lost some BTC doing this! :(

See my history and you can see that I'm a Binance's supporter since long time ago, and I still am. But, 2 hours ago I posted if I anyone felt that the Binance's API is slow these days. Because I wonder if the problem is in my end or not. The post got removed: https://np.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/comments/8fwbb9/api_is_slow_than_it_used_to_be/ and I have no idea why it got removed. In /r/CryptoCurrency you will get a message why your post is removed.

And I check the other posts which criticized Binance and they got removed also https://np.reddit.com/r/BinanceExchange/comments/7v5yga/my_1_mini_criticism_about_binance/ I bet the OP didn't even know why it got removed.

I love Binance, but you guys shouldn't censor people who are complaining about the platform. Moreover, I wasn't really complaining, I was only asking if it's only me or not. 

At least give an explanation or create a daily thread to accommodate such discussions.

---WARNING%3A+KuCoin+Exchange+-+Stay+Away---
This is a warning to anyone dealing with Crypto to NOT use KuCoin exchange due to their shady and malicious attitude towards their customers.

Take a look at the sub and all the items they censor here.

https://www.ceddit.com/r/kucoin

Many accounts get banned for even mentioning issues like mine has. I created a posting simply asking about why our airdrops have not been delivered and after having many users back me up my account was banned.

I am making it my goal to make sure that everyone is made aware of how deceptive and scam ridden KuCoin exchange is and I have numerous people who can agree with me.

You will also see many shill accounts try to defend them in their sub and most likely on this thread as well. If your smart enough to deal in Crypto I believe you will be smart enough to detect this. If you have been wronged by this exchange I ask you tell your story so people can avoid them at all cost.

Seems like they have to be connected in someway -- Then how exactly, say if GDAX wants to drop $300 and finex wants to hold up at X price, how do they stay similar prices? I know there's a spread but the walls for buyer/seller are always different on other exchanges so they have to be connected some how.

Also you've seen on gdax, very small buys that move the price up -- I assume this has to be due to other exchanges moving up and gdax has to move up their price too somehow? But how does that work exactly.
